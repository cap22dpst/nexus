                                recommends C++ because a lot of support and implementation of various algorithms are
                                present on the internet, plus C++ is fast and there have been some situations where a
                                logically same solution in java or python gets a TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) result while
                                C++ gets a correct answer).

                                        recommends you to participate in codeforces (for short contests and practice)
                                        and codechef (for long contests). A lot of people will advise you to begin from
                                        hackerrank but Nexus would suggest you to use it in a different manner and the
                                        reson for that is explained in “HOW TO PRACTICE” section.</p>

                            <p class="mb-1">Learn what standard template library (STL) is and its syntax. This step is
                                most important for you to get a good rank in contests because in contests first two
                                questions are generally based on STL/implementation/maths and if you can solve that in
                                less than 10 to 20 minutes then you are already ahead of beginners. For learning STL we
                                would suggest you to go through the syntax from sites like geeksforgeeks or there is an
                                excellent video available on YouTube by Rachit Jain. Links for all the sites and
                                tutorial mentioned here are in the “TUTORIALS” section and its okay if you can’t
                                remember the syntax because nobody does in their first attempt that’s why should
                                bookmark the STL implementations on your browser and after some practice you will be
                                able to remember all the important and frequent ones.</p>

                                your real time performance just by practicing questions as you will definitely perform
                                differently under the pressure of time limit and ranks and we will suggest you to not
                                take stress or demotivation from ranks and ratings during the initial phase of your
                                journey because rating is just a parameter to show how well you will perform during a

                                person. We will link a spreadsheet made by Mostafa Saad, which describes two different
                                ways of practice and has problems associated with them: one is solving topic wise
                                problems while the other is solving difficulty wise random problems.</p>

                                codeforces according to difficulty rating in range 800-900.</p>

                            <p class="mb-1">And you should spend at least 15-20 minutes on a problem and if you are not
                                able to solve the problem then you should take a look at the tutorial section which will
                                contain its solution and explanation.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-1">You should read its explanation and if it states something that you don’t
                                know (say something like prefix sums) then you should learn about that first through
                                various sites like geeksforgeeks or cp-algorithms (links in "TUTORIAL” section) or there
                                are many handbooks available online like by Antti Laaksonen or by Halim and Halim and
                                after learning the concept you should solve some problems related to that concept and
                                after that implement that problem on your own and if you are unable to attempt then you
                                should take a look at its code and implement it. If you are able to solve the problem in
                                the first go then also you should take a look at the code submitted by some other coders
                                as it might teach you some different approaches. When you feel comfortable in solving
                                problems from a particular range you should increase its difficulty.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="mb-1">You should follow this till that range reaches 1100, after that we will
                                change our approach. Now we will be giving at least 1 contest a week and 2 virtual
                                contests (explained after a few lines) in a week. You should spend your whole allotted
                                time into solving these problems; if you are not able to solve a problem then you should
                                at least read that problem and think about it for 5-10 minutes and when the contest
                                finishes you should UPSOLVE those problems that you were able to read after going
                                through the tutorial which is usually released within 12 hours after contest finishes
                                but now as the difficulty of the problems have been increased if you encounter any topic
                                that you haven’t done before you should learn that from a site known as cp-algorithms.
                                Now after learning the algorithm you must be able to implement that for that HackerRank
                                comes into the picture as in competitive programming no one asks you to implement a
                                regular algorithm rather they would ask you to implement its twisted form so to practice
                                regular implementation you should definitely use hackerrank.</p>
